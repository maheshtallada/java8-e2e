hashCode() Method :: 

public int hashCode()
This method returns an integer value, which is referred to as the hash code value of an object. Every Object, at the time of creation will be assigned with a unique 32-bit, signed int value. This value is the hash code value of that object.

General contract associated with hashCode() method ::

1. The hashCode() method should return the same integer value for the same object for each calling of this method unless the value stored in the object is modified.
2. If two objects are equal(according to equals() method) then the hashCode() method should return the same integer value for both the objects.

 .. that is if we override equals, we have to override hashcode.
3. But, it is not necessary that the hashCode() method will return the distinct result for the objects that are not equal (according to equals() method).
