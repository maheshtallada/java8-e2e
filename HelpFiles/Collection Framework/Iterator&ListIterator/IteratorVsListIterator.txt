An Iterator is an interface in Java and we can traverse the elements of a list in a forward direction whereas a ListIterator is an interface that extends the Iterator interface and we can traverse the elements in both forward and backward directions. 

An Iterator can be used in these collection types like List, Set, and Queue whereas ListIterator can be used in List collection only. 

The important methods of Iterator interface are hasNext(), next() and remove() whereas important methods of ListIterator interface are add(), hasNext(), hasPrevious() and remove(), set()
