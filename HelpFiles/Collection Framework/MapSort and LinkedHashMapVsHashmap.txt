LinkedHashMap vs HashMap ::

The LinkedHashMap is quite similar to HashMap, with an additional feature of maintaining the order of the inserted element.

HashMap is a powerful data structure in Java used to store the key-pair values. It maps a value by its associated key. It allows us to store the null values and null keys. It is a non-synchronized class of Java collection. Whereas the LinkedHashMap is an alternative to HashMap that has the support of maintaining the order of the elements.

Some key points about HashMap are as following:

It contains key-pair values.
It can not have duplicate keys.
It may have one null key and multiple null values.
It is non-synchronized.
It does not provide a way to maintain the order of elements.
The default capacity of the Java HashMap class is 16 with a load factor of 0.75.


Some key points about the LinkedHashMap are as following:

It stores the values in the key-pair combination.
It can not have duplicate elements.
It may have one null key and multiple null values.
It is non synchronized.
It provides an easy way to maintain the insertion order
