1. Differrence between ClassNotFoundException and NoClassDefFoundError ?
	ClassNotFoundException occurs when classpath does not get updated with required JAR files while error occurs when the required class definition is not present at runtime.
	
2. How can we decide that custom exception should be checked or unchecked in java?
	If you want to write a checked exception that is automatically enforced by the Handle or Declare Rule, you need to extend the Exception class.
	If you want to write a runtime exception, you need to extend the RuntimeException class.
