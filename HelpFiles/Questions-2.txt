1. Can we write public static void main() in any order ?
	NO, not in any order, but
	YES, we can change the order of public static void main() to static public void main() in Java, the compiler doesn't throw any compile-time or runtime error. 
	In Java, we can declare access modifiers in any order, the method name comes last, the return type comes second to last and then after it's our choice.

2. How to overload and override main method in Java?
	OVERLOAD : similar to -- public static void main(String[] args)
	We can pass differen types of arguments as below.
	
	public static void main(int args)
	public static void main(char args)
	public static void main(Double[] args)
	
	Yes, We can overload the main method in java but JVM only calls the original main method, it will never call our overloaded main method.
	So, to execute overloaded methods of main, we must call them from the original main method.
	
	OVERRIDE : 	No, we cannot override main method of java because a static method cannot be overridden.
