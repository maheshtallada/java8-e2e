Searching without Indexes:
	Sequential: (Table scan)
		when we search for a value, it scans all the values until the value matches to required value.
		Obviously, this will have performance issues.
	Solution : B-Tree Structure
	
B-Tree: (Index Scan)
	1. It has 
		Root nodes,
		Non-leaf nodes ,
		leaf nodes
	2. refer picture.
	3. let's say we are searcing for 50, 
		3.1	It will compare 30 and 50 and eliminates all values under 30	--	Root Node
		3.2	Now it will compare 40, 50 	and eliminates 40 and below			--	Non-Leaf nodes
		3.3 Now it will compare all the values from 41-50 and concludes equalit at 50	--	Leaf nodes
