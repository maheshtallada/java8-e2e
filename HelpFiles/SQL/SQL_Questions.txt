2. What is view and why is it used ?
	Views in SQL are kind of virtual tables. A view also has rows and columns as they are in a real table in the database. We can create a view by selecting fields from one or more tables present in the database. A View can either have all the rows of a table or specific rows based on certain condition.
	Views can act as aggregated tables.	
	A view is created by writing a query with required rows and columns and saving it as a view, so that only required data can be given to respective personnel, without exposing sensitive information.
	
3. What is Index
	Indexes are special lookup tables that the database search engine can use to speed up data retrieval. Simply put, an index is a pointer to data in a table. An index in a database is very similar to an index in the back of a book.
	
	Without indexes, tablescan needs to be done to find the result, which drastically reduces performace.
	
	Indexes are created for tables and views
