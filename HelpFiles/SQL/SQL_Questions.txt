1. How to find the nth highest salary ?
		
		Select min(salary) from (Select distinct salary from emp order by salary desc) where rownum < n+1;
		
		1. get the distinct sal in desc order.
		2. < n+1 rownum gives n rows
		3. finding min in first n rows gives nth highest salary
		
2. What is view and why is it used ?
	Views in SQL are kind of virtual tables. A view also has rows and columns as they are in a real table in the database. We can create a view by selecting fields from one or more tables present in the database. A View can either have all the rows of a table or specific rows based on certain condition.
	Views can act as aggregated tables.	
	A view is created by writing a query with required rows and columns and saving it as a view, so that only required data can be given to respective personnel, without exposing sensitive information.
	
3. What is Index
	Indexes are special lookup tables that the database search engine can use to speed up data retrieval. Simply put, an index is a pointer to data in a table. An index in a database is very similar to an index in the back of a book.
	
	Without indexes, tablescan needs to be done to find the result, which drastically reduces performace.
	
	Indexes are created for tables and views
		
	Working : It uses a B-Tree for creating table of indexes.
	
4. What is Unique key in SQL ?
	i.   A unique key is a set of one or more than one column(s) of a table that uniquely identify a record in a database table.
	ii.  You can say that it is little like primary key but it can accept only one null value and it cannot have duplicate values.
	iii. The unique key and primary key both provide a guarantee for uniqueness for a column or a set of columns.
	iv.  There is an automatically defined unique key constraint within a primary key constraint.
	
	Ex: (for multiple columns) :
			CREATE TABLE students  
			(  
			S_Id int NOT NULL,  
			LastName varchar (255) NOT NULL,  
			FirstName varchar (255),  
			City varchar (255),  
			CONSTRAINT uc_studentId UNIQUE (S_Id, LastName)  
			) 
		
		(for single column) : 
		
		way1: 
			
			CREATE TABLE students  
			(  
			S_Id int NOT NULL UNIQUE,  
			LastName varchar (255) NOT NULL,  
			FirstName varchar (255),  
			City varchar (255)  
			)  
		way2: 
			CREATE TABLE students  
			(  
			S_Id int NOT NULL,  
			LastName varchar (255) NOT NULL,  
			FirstName varchar (255),  
			City varchar (255),  
			UNIQUE (S_Id)  
			)  
5. How do you call Stored procedures in JDBC, similar to PreparedStatement, what is the statment type used here ?
	CallableStatement
6. What is the difference between Composite primary key and unique key ?
	A PRIMARY KEY has a UNIQUE constraint by default. While in some tables, there won't be any columns with a unique value to define a row. In such cases COMPOSITE KEYs are used. In such cases two or more columns are combined together so that this combination is unique
	
	The UNIQUE constraint uniquely identifies each record in a database table.Unique key can accept NULL
	
	Note that you can have many UNIQUE constraints per table, but only one PRIMARY KEY constraint per table.
7. What is Unique keyword in SQL and any link with unique key for this ?

	Both are same, unique can be applied on single or group or columns. this is called Unique key.
	Any no. of unique keys can be present in a table.
