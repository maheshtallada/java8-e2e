JUnit is a framework that helps with writing and running unit tests. 
Mockito (or any other mocking tool) is a framework that we specifically use to efficiently write certain kind of tests.


1. Most of the business operations deal with Databases and to achieve proper Code coverage, we need to hit Databases even for testing. 
2. Here the Mockito comes into picture. The Service calls redirects to Mockito instead of repository layer.

1. for methods which return something -- when(<actualmethod>).thenReturn(<dummydata>)   --- this means returning a stub
		Stubs are the Objects that act as temporary replacement for a called object and give the same output as that of the actual product.
2. verify(<the_instance>, times).<method name> -- this will test how many times the class is called.
