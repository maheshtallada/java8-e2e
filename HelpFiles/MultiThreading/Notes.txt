1. What is volatile keyword in Java ?
	only one variables, not on classes and methods.
	“volatile” tells the compiler that the value of a variable must never be cached as its value may change outside of the scope of the program itself.
	
	i.   Volatile keyword is used to modify the value of a variable by different threads. 
	ii.  It is also used to make classes thread safe.
	iii. It means that multiple threads can use a method and instance of the classes at the same time without any problem. 
	iv.  The volatile keyword can be used either with primitive type or objects.
	v.   The volatile keyword does not cache the value of the variable and always read the variable from the main memory.
	vi.  It is used as alternative to synchronization keyword and helps in better performance compared to latter.
