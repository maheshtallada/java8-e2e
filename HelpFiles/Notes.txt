Now the question is, how the compiler is sorting items of same id

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are few methods in Comparator interface ::

thenComparing(keyExtractor)
thenComparing(comparator)
thenComparing(keyExtractor, comparator)
thenComparingDouble(keyExtractor)
thenComparingInt(keyExtractor)
thenComparingLong(keyExtractor)



Comparator.comparingInt
Comparator.comparingLong
Comparator.comparingDouble
etc.,


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comparable vs Comparator ::

While using comparable, we have to manipulate the pojo by extending it to Comparable interface and override compareTo method for our custom sorting technique.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is Comparator a function interface, but it has two abstract methods?

Yes, Comparator is a functional interface. The equals is an abstract method overriding one of the public methods of java.lang.Object, this doesnâ€™t count as an abstract method.
